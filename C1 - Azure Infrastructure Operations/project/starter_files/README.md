# Azure Infrastructure Operations Project: Deploying a scalable IaaS web server in Azure

This repository contains the project, which demonstrates the deployment of a policy and an image created from a Packer template. The resulting image is then used by Terraform for infrastructure deployment.

---

## **Project Overview**

This project involves:

1. Creating a policy and assigning it to a resource group.
2. Building a virtual machine image using  **Packer** .
3. Deploying infrastructure using  **Terraform** .

---

## **Dependencies**

Ensure you have the following installed and set up before proceeding:

1. Create an [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Install the [Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
3. Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads)
4. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

## **Setup and Deployment**

### **1. Export Environment Variables**

Before running Packer or Terraform, export the following environment variables with your Azure credentials. Add them to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent shell configuration file for easier reuse:

```bash
export AZ_CLIENT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
export AZ_CLIENT_SECRET=00000000000000000000000000000000
export AZ_TENANT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
export AZ_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

**Note:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual Azure credentials.

---

### **2. Create a Resource Group**

Create a resource group for this project using either the Azure Portal or Azure CLI:

**Using Azure CLI:**

```bash
az group create --name udacity-assignment1-rg --location <location>
```

---

### **3. Deploy the Policy**

Deploy the policy and assign it to your resource group. You can do this via the Azure Portal or Azure CLI.

---

### **4. Build the Packer Image**

Run the following command to build the Packer image:

```bash
packer build packer/server.json
```

---

### **5. Prepare Terraform**

Navigate to the Terraform directory and initialize the Terraform configuration:

```bash
terraform init
```

Generate an execution plan:

```bash
terraform plan -out solution.plan
```

---

### **6. Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform**

Apply the Terraform plan to deploy your infrastructure:

```bash
terraform apply "solution.plan"
```

---

### **7. Clean Up**

To destroy the infrastructure after testing, run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

---

## **Configuration**

The file `terraform/vars.tf` contains all the variables used in `terraform/main.tf`. If you need to customize the deployment (e.g., resource names, regions, or VM configurations), modify the variables in `vars.tf`.
